Questions:

**Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**

I teach at Seattle Central College, in the Immigrant and Refugee Program. I have found myself, again and again, encouraging my students to pursue careers in STEM fields. The more research I did about incorporating technology into the classroom, the more I saw how compatible the skill sets were with students, primarily women, who'd been previously overlooked and underrepresented in the field. Like many of my students, I grew up in a very conservative home, believing there were jobs for men and jobs for women. My younger brother, in fact, did go on to become a programmer. I realized that many of the skills I shared with him, with other developers, were the raw materials I needed to create a career in programming- the ability to solve problems logically, to learn languages easily, to recognize patterns rapidly and notice the importance in details.

Before I had even learned of Ada, I was taking basic tutorials online and at Seattle Central College. Much of my experience and education has been self-taught. I have learned the basics of Python through a children's programming book, "Hello, World." I've completed courses in Java and HTML at Codecademy, and learned the basics of Ruby and Rails at FreeCodeCamp. I am currently working on a website that is an interactive family tree just for my family, all first and second generation immigrants and far from home. It's a big challenge for me, but an important one. I also have an account with GitHub where I'm uploading practice programs I've been working on simply by rewriting pre-existing code to my own format. I'm learning through doing.



**If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**

My five year plan involves taking what I know now about education and what I will learn about coding and blending them together to create better access to educational technology. I'm hoping that means software development, making laptops and internet available to all students, and training young coders in development- all these goals are made with the intention of leveling the playing field of privilege. Access to education should be a fundamental right, but is often only a privilege, even for students in first world countries. In the United States, the divide between public and private school educations underscores the profound financial divide in our class system. Statistically, students in private schools perform better and take more credited courses- but is this due to a higher quality of education? Parents who can afford to be more present in their children's education? Students not needing to work a job to support themselves through high school? Education is, to me, the ultimate litmus test of a community, and the nuance behind what causes academic success is not easily compartmentalized. I am reminded of Peggy McIntosh's essay, "The Invisible Knapsack," where she posits that we are all born with a knapsack containing certain privilege, certain access, codebooks, passports- and those privileges help us get farther than those with less in their knapsacks.

I believe that access to tech can profoundly affect a person's worldview. I served in the United States Peace Corps In West Africa, just as internet-accessible mobile phones were becoming popular. In my village of Béréba, Burkina Faso, we spent equal time at the library and at the local mobile phone repair shop, where we could crowd around a tiny screen and watch illegally downloaded movies from China, the United States, and France. The local kids learned a lot just through seeing images of cultures outside their own- and I think the world would benefit from seeing images of them, too.

In five years, I want to be building free technology that will be accessible to all students, regardless their country of origin, financial status, gender- or any of the contents of their "knapsack." I want to work with a company like Apex Learning or Enlearn, both of whom sponsor Ada, to create a learning platform that is tailored to each student's "learning DNA" (from Enlearn's website) and has free access to courses, classes, and tutoring and mentoring programs. I want to teach students how to code, and encourage them to pursue careers in the STEM fields. I want my students and neighbors from Seattle to get as much exposure to the cultures and climates of places like West Africa as West Africans have to them. Tech transforms people and cultures, and I want to be part of that transformation.

**After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?**	


I think women and female-identified people are the largest untapped natural resource in our country today. That doesn't even begin to explore other marginalized communities- people of color, the disabled, the neurologically diverse; women are often the umbrella for which many other minority groups exist. I am a queer, Jewish, disabled, gay woman. However, my experience has afforded me privilege not available to everyone.

As a young girl, I was raised to believe I could do and be anything- as long as I still believed in God, obeyed my parents, got married, had children, and didn't do a "man's job." Due to severe neglect and abuse, I was removed from my parent's home and sought emancipation as a teenager. I was able to attend my first two years of college at a public university in New York, and then was granted a scholarship to Oxford University and upon completion, finished my degree at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. I became a TA and had a full scholarship to graduate school, where I finished my Master's with a 4.0 GPA. 

Education was a sacred thing to me; it was conditional and a privilege reserved for the wealthy. I was constantly in fear of losing my scholarships, of being found a fraud and sent home. This fear, this unstable relationship with higher education, led me to make many life choices that a wealthier student, a student with financial security, with parental support, with family and a lifeline, wouldn't have to make. I had to work full time through every year of school, and even worked illegally overseas teaching English and tutoring. I didn't drink alcohol until I was done with both college and grad school and knew I would never miss a class or allow too much fun to affect my grades. I was deeply, deeply serious about my education, even going so far as to learn four new languages in order to better succeed in whatever community I was living in. I look back on my choices and my life and am proud of my accomplishments amidst adversity, but I still have regrets. 

I regret that my fear of scarcity of access to education informed more of decision making than my own desire and dreams did. I was encouraged to become a teacher, a career deemed safe and reliable. I love teaching, and have taught for over ten years, but I am no longer in a place where I feel I can enact the kind of change I'm envisioning. 

I now teach at Seattle Central with the Immigrant and Refugee Program, and I also teach a social justice program that I created for several synagogues in the Seattle area. I have amazing students, amazing jobs. The thing is, I don't want any other kid to feel the way I did- I don't want money to affect someone's ability to learn or have access to education. If I want to fight both informational and class-based ignorance, if I want to support intersectionality and visibility, working at the classroom level feels too small. I feel like I'm educating the students that already understand the problems on some level- but their parents don't. Or the deans don't. Or the technology I need doesn't exist. 

I went to an informational session for Ada last week, and felt so inspired. I can't tell you how revelatory it felt to sit in the front row, transcribing everything the speakers said, listening to folks from different communities, different socio-economic backgrounds, different levels of education. I have spent my life feeling different, embodying both diversity and invisible privilege, fighting for visibility and fighting for my right to an education. I want to be a part of a place like Ada that celebrates the incredible fighters in our society- those often denied rights and have had to find creative ways to get them back and make them better. I want to sit on that panel and say, "you can come from nothing, be considered nothing, be given nothing, and achieve everything."



**Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**


While I was serving in the United States Peace Corps, I wrestled a lot with my identity and purpose. I was wary, upon my acceptance to my post in West Africa, of acting like a "white savior." I didn't want to saunter into a community that, however different from mine, still had organization, and customs, and practices I needed to respect. How much space am I taking up? How am I showing respect for the culture? How am I behaving like a leader (which is bad) and how am I behaving like a facilitator (which is better)? I often questioned my place in the community, fearing I was infiltrating something that I wasn't a part of, fearing I was part of an organization that was built on soft diplomacy and nothing more than ornamental.

I did a lot of good work there. My biggest project was surveying the community to see what they wanted changed- and many of them identified the largest problem being the destroyed road from our town to the next one. We didn't have electricity or plumbing in our village, and had no doctors or cars. There was just one road that connected us to the hospital, but it often was in such disrepair it would take two or three hours to travel it by the one bus that would travel through. 

I biked the whole thing and took photos of the flooding, the erosion, the potholes and small, deep lakes that formed during the rainy season. I thought if America could see it, they would be shocked and want to help. We raised a bit of money, but it wasn't until I'd harassed the government of Burkina Faso enough that we reached our goal of $40,000. 

I asked my friends, all women, to spearhead the project. It was often they that suffered the most without the road- between births and the health of their children and safety of their husbands (who were often miners or dehydrated, overworked farmers), they seemed to care the most passionately about finding a solution.

They assigned jobs, found contractors, and dug irrigation ditches. My students and I planted a little over a thousand trees over the several miles of road, in an effort to absorb the flooding from the runoff of rainy season. Finally, the women had it paved, and when I went back to my village a few years ago, it was still getting people to the hospital in 20 minutes instead of two and half hours.

I'm happy with how that project worked out. The only real mistake I believe I made was that I didn't use enough social media, enough email blasts. I didn't take enough photos or share enough of the experience and testimonials. Yes, my access to technology was limited to my Blackberry and a car battery I used to charge it- but I really believe that if I had made more money stateside, I would have had to ask for less from the government of Burkina. That money could have gone to another town without road access, without electricity. It could have gone to Girls' Education and the fight against female genital mutilation. It could have gone to HIV prevention and awareness. I know that we did a great job, and most of the work was done by the community that benefitted from it, but what if most of the money had come from OUTSIDE the community? Burkina Faso is the third poorest country in the world, and the United States, the wealthiest. Compared to the total donations to the project, less than 1% came from the United States while the rest came from Burkina. I believe I really could have increased that number and had far less impact as a result on the local government, while still maintaining a relatively small impact on my network back home.

***Above***:  *the artwork created for my essay in Jezebel*

When I returned to the United States, I wrote an article for Jezebel, a feminist lifestyle blog, about my experience in Burkina Faso and unfortunately, being the victim of a sexual assault and how I was living with rape shame. I decided, upon its publication, to have a huge fundraiser for New Beginnings, one of Seattle's oldest non-profits that assists survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. I was determined to not make the same mistake I had made in Burkina, and got some fantastic social networkers together to really hype up the event. It was called "Speak Against the Silence, the Shame, the Stigma" and featured many local activists and speakers, artists, writers, poets, and musicians. We did a silent auction of donations from local Seattle businesses and events- Sub Pop, Capitol Hill Block Party, Atomic Cosmetics, Babeland, SugarPill, and more. I created a website, a meet-up group, even a bank account just for our donations. We ended up raising several thousand dollars- not too shabby for an event that was planned in a month, that existed completely on donated items and donated time, and lived almost entirely on the web and Facebook. It was a huge success, but one that I would not have had without my past mistake. Without understanding how powerful social media and networking can be, I couldn't have been a part of something I find so deeply important.

Thank you for taking the time to review all this. I'm so grateful that a place like Ada exists, and hope you see me as someone who could contribute to your program and environment I so deeply admire.
